## Getting and Cleaning Data  Project 
Paul Ke

Repository for the submission of the John Hopkins "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course

### Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and formation of a tidy dataset to be used for analysis.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
[The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

###Project Information
The (run_analysis.R) script will demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The overall project will contain:
1) a tidy data set
2) a link to this Github repository with this script.
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to cleanup the data in CodeBook.md

This README in intended to explain how the script works and how everything is connected, the goal for the script are to ensure that it:
	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	
### Additional Information
Additional information regarding the dataset variables and tidy process can be found in CodeBook.MD file.
